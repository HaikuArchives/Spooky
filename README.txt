What have we got here
	A module for Blanket, the screensaver by Duncan Wilcox.

What's it called?
	Spooky

What does it do
	Duh... it blanks your screen!

How to install
	You DO have Blanket 1.0 already installed, don't you?
	Copy Spooky to "/boot/home/config/add-ons/Screen Savers" and select it from
	the Blanket preferences program.

	The archive also contains the SpookySource, for those who wish to peek
	inside this piece of 'darkware'.

How to use
	Do nothing, after a while the blanker will do its work..... ;-)

Who made it
	Gertjan van Ratingen <gertjan@a1200.iaehv.nl>

The boring, legal stuff
	I'm not responsible for what you do to it, or what it does to your neighbour's dog
	and the rest of the world.
	All of this package is public domain. So if you want to use it in your own blanker,
	go ahead. And don't forget to upload your blanker to ftp.be.com!
